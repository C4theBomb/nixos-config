# Symphony

stuff

![Logo](./demo.png)

Meticulously crafted collection of NixOS configurations tailored for my systems. This repository encapsulates a unified setup across different machines, ensuring a consistent and efficient environment no matter where Iâ€™m working. The configurations are designed with modularity and clarity in mind, making it easy to adapt and scale. Whether it's setting up a new machine or refining an existing setup, Symphony brings what I believe to be the best practices in NixOS configuration management, unified under a single, cohesive structure. System and home manager configurations are kept separate to keep configuration flexible and modular.

| System 	| Architecture                   	| Description                               	|
|--------	|--------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------	|
| arisu  	| `x86_64-linux`                 	| primary development tower, custom built   	|
| kokoro 	| `x86_64-linux`                 	| ThinkBook 15 laptop, mobile development   	|
| chibi 	| `aarch64-linux`                	| Raspberry Pi 4B for hosting and local dev 	|
| hikari 	| `x86_64-linux`                	| custom installer ISO, new systems and VMs 	|
